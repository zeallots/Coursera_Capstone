    "<b>Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.</b>\n",

    "Problem: Choosing schools often is a huge decision for parents, especially for weary-eyed parents hoping to have their kids stay in school and study as far away from 'attractions' as possible. There will be a couple of assumptions for the below problems\n",
    "1) These parents are in Hong Kong and are placing kids into International Secondary Schools (kids have ability to roam free either during lunch or immediately after school). Hence not considering primary schools or kindergartens.\n",
    "2) Some stereotypical attraction-joints that parents are keen to avoid include arcades, gaming-areas, shopping malls, bars, clubs etc. Let this list not be exhaustive, but also be known as \"the list\".\n",
    "3) The consideration would be \"walking distance\" from schools, definted as less than 200 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By no means does this study aim to define what is the best school just by highlighting what attractions there are, but it aims to highlight the different or similarity on shops are around schools. If there are any venues that are mentioned in \"the list\" it was also be flagged."

    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "The longitude and latitude data are provided by a CSV by the government. However it uses a Degree, Minutes and Seconds for Latitude and Longitude, so there needs to be a conversion to Decimal Degree Latitude and Longitude. So this would rquire some data cleaning. \n",

    "Then after isolating and getting the correct lat long data form the office source, this would then be used to query foursquare API for the nearby venues within a limit of 200 meters.\n",
